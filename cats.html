        <h2>Brown Tabby Cat (SIC)</h2>
        <p>
            Brown tabby cats (also referred to as standard issue cats (SIC) on reddit) are such sweethearts. There are a
            few that spend time around my home but one that consistently comes back for food and pets. One of my
            friends, who is a cat mom, told me that cat is a girl. I wish I could adopt her!

        <h2>Bicolor Cat (Tuxedo)</h2>
        <p>
            My unofficial first cat was a feral tuxedo cat that lived around my home. When I first noticed her, I began
            leaving food outside and ever since, she continued coming back to my house. Some months later, I named her
            Beyonce because she gave birth to two kittens around the same time the megastar, Beyonce, birthed her twins.

        <h2>Bengal Cat</h2>
        <p>
            If you've ever seen a bengal cat before, you already know they are absolutely, breath-takingly beautiful!
            One of the many reasons they are so hard to find and adopt for economically feasible prices. I will never
            lose hope in adopting one though.
