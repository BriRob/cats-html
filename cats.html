        <h2>Tuxedo Cat</h2>
        <p>
            My unofficial first cat was a feral tuxedo cat that lived around my home. When I first noticed her, I began
            leaving food outside and ever since, she continued coming back to my house. Some months later, I named her
            Beyonce because she gave birth to two kittens around the same time the megastar, Beyonce, birthed her twins.

        <h2>Bengal Cat</h2>
        <p>
            If you've ever seen a bengal cat before, you already know they are absolutely, breath-takingly beautiful!
            One of the many reasons they are so hard to find and adopt for economically feasible prices. I will never
            lose hope in
            adopting one though.
